# AnalysisToolGUI

A Graphical User Interface for the AnalysisTool project


## Dependencies

This project depends on JogAmp's Java3D revival, download found [here][1].

Java3D itself relies on JogAmp's Java OpenGL bindings and GlueGen library,
which can be found [here][2].

Of course, you will also need to have built AnalysisTool.
